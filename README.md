# Hyprland-dracula

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracula/hyprland/main/screenshot.png)

## Why

- You don't want to use GNOME/KDE, but you want a reasonable wayland setup
- You don't want to spend days/weeks setting up something that should be ready out of the box with little to no manual configuration
- You don't want someone else's unfamiliar, painfully gaudy, and over-complicated setup
- You are familiar with dwm, dwl, xmonad, and/or awesome-wm
